# Graph Classification
Supervised binary graph classification as positives or negatives by tuning 6 Graph neural networks (4 Graph Convolutional Neural Network architectures and 2 GraphSage architectures) and downsampling negatives for imbalanced class problems. 

## Instructions

Create a folder called data and store your input data in the folder. Example positive-negative protein complex data can be constructed from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4814944
